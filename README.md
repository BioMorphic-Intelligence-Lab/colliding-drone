This is the repository to the paper: "A Tactile Feedback Approach to Path Recovery after High-Speed Impacts for Collision-Resilient Drones"

The repository lists all used sub-repositories:
- ```colliding-drone-py-sim```: This repository contains a prelimenary study in python on how a colliding tensegrity MAV behaves, including some visualization tools.
- ```collision-based-replanning```: This repository contains a prelimenary study in python on how the collision based path-replanner works, including some visualization tools.
- ```drone_trajectory_plots```: This repository contains most of the plotting scripts used to generate the figures of the paper.
  ```tensegrity_flightcontroller```: This repository contains the public parts of the implemented flight controller in C++
